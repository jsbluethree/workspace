TODO: Test EVERYTHING  
TODO: Make sure all pure virtual interface classes have virtual destructors defined  
TODO: QTSceneGraph: Rewrite check_collision to short circuit on finding a collision rather than checking the whole set  
TODO: QTSceneGraph: Rewrite check_ and get_collision to have a single base case on a rect, and all other overloads refer to that algorithm  
TODO: Make a not shitty JSON parser  
  
CONSIDER: ISceneGraph: defining check_ and get_collision for non-rect cases here
